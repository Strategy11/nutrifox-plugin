Embed Nutrifox recipes in WordPress in one moment or less.

## Description ##

The Nutrifox plugin allows users easily to embed Nutrifox nutrition labels in their WordPress posts. Simply paste the URL for a Nutrifox label into a WordPress post or page and see a live preview of the label in the editor.

### The information your readers want ###

Nutrifox allows publishers to give their readers the nutrition information they want to see. A comprehensive food database and fine-grain control of ingredients and label display gives publishers freedom and informational power. The Nutrifox WordPress plugin makes it easy to share this information with readers.

### Flexible integration ###

Paste the URL for your Nutrifox label into either the visual or the text tab in the WordPress post editor. In the visual tab, the URL will be replaced with a live preview of the label. 

If a Nutrifox embed code is placed in the text tab, it will be replaced with a Nutrifox shortcode in both the visual and text views.

## Installation ##

The Nutrifox plugin can be installed much like any other WordPress plugin.

1. Upload the plugin ZIP archive file via "Plugins" -> "Add New" in the WordPress admin, or extract the files and upload them via FTP.
2. Activate the Nutrifox plugin through the "Plugins" list in the WordPress admin.

With Nutrifox, there aren't any confusing settings to configure or customizations you need to worry about. You can now share your nutrition labels with the world!
